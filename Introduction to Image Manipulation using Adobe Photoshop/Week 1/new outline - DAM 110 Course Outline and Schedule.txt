Feathering
Soft Edge
Creating edge effects
You can use various techniques to treat the edges of an effect applied to only part of an image. To leave a distinct edge, simply apply the filter. For a soft edge, feather the edge, and then apply the filter. For a transparent effect, apply the filter, and then use the Fade command to adjust the selectionâ€™s blending mode and opacity.

Applying filters to individual channels
You can apply a filter to an individual channel, apply a different effect to each color channel, or apply the same filter but with different settings.
